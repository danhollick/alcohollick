# My personal site

Built the site as a way of teaching myself React. 

It uses React Boilerplate as a base. Only realised much later that a lighter wirght boilerplate would have probably been better. So there is still a bunch of stuff I don't use that I need to rip out of the boilerplate code.

React Boilerplate ships with Styled Components, so I use that. Except my styling code is way more complicated than it needs to be. I wanted to use tachyons here, because it's heckn dope. So I used tachyons-for-styled-components, which makes use of tachyons-JS, so that I can write tachyons style abbreviations on my styled components. This probably made things less component-ey than is ideal. But I don't really care.

Also, it was a huge f*cking ball-ached to set most of this up, and it is fragile as hell.
