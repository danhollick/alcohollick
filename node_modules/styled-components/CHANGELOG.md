## [Upcoming Major Release]

- Update css-to-react-native - you'll now need to add units to your React Native styles (see [css-to-react-native](https://github.com/styled-components/css-to-react-native/issues/20), [code mod](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components-native-code-mod))
- Update stylis to latest version (see [#496](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/496)).
- Added per-component class names (see [#227](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/227)).
- Added the ability to override one component's styles from another.
- Injecting an empty class for each instance of a component.
- Added `attrs` constructor for passing extra attributes to the underlying element
- Added warnings for components generating a lot of classes, thanks to [@vdanchenkov](https://github.com/vdanchenkov). (see [#268](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/268))
- Standardised `styled(Comp)` to work the same in all cases, rather than a special extension case where `Comp` is another Styled Component. `Comp.extend` now covers that case. (see [#518](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/518)).
- Added a separate `no-parser` entrypoint for preprocessed CSS, which doesn't depend on stylis. The preprocessing is part of our babel plugin. (see [babel-plugin-styled-components/#26](https://github.com/styled-components/babel-plugin-styled-components/pull/26))
- Fix defaultProps used instead of ThemeProvider on first render [@k15a](https://github.com/k15a), restored.
- Refactor StyledComponent for performance optimization.
- Prevent leakage of the `innerRef` prop to wrapped child; under the hood it is converted into a normal React `ref`. (see [#592](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/592))
- Pass `innerRef` through to wrapped Styled Components, so that it refers to the actual DOM node. (see [#629](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/629))
