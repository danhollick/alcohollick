*\*\* The code for this section is*¬†*[here](https://github.com/danhollick/zebra/tree/master/step3).\*\**

In this chapter we are going to be manipulating the UI based on the updates we receive from the plugin sandbox. Go ahead and open up `ui.html` if you don‚Äôt have it open already and update it like this:

```html
<div id="background">
  <h3 id="foreground">The quick brown fox</h3>
</div>
<h2 id="contrast"></h2>
<script>
  window.onmessage = async event => {
    const message = event.data.pluginMessage
    console.log(message)
    if (message.type === 'selectionChange') {
      const background = document.getElementById('background')
      const foreground = document.getElementById('foreground')
      const contrast = document.getElementById('contrast')
      background.style = `background-color: ${message.background};`
      foreground.style = `color: ${message.foreground};`
      contrast.textContent = message.contrast
    }
  }
</script>
```

We added some html to display some of our results and in `<script/>` we are using some browser methods to find and alter those html elements when we receive a new message.

If we click around we should see the plugin UI update:

## üîÅ Swapping the Foreground and Background

If you are like me, you‚Äôll be a bit annoyed that we can‚Äôt swap the two colours around. This is especially annoying because the order of the layers in `figma.currentPage.selection`¬†*is basically random* so we can‚Äôt reliably pick which layer will be which.

To solve this we are going to add a button to the UI to swap the current colours around. When the button is clicked we want to post a message back to the sandbox to swap those colours around. This is what the message posting looks like on this end:

```html
// ...
<button id="swap"></button>
<script>
  window.onmessage = async event => {
    //...
  }
  document.getElementById('swap').onclick = () => {
    parent.postMessage({ pluginMessage: { type: 'swap' } }, '*')
  }
</script>
```

We get the button and assign an `onclick` handler to it. This handler fires off `parent.postMessage` to send a message from the `iframe` and give it a `type` of `swap`.

Then in the `code.js` we need to listen for the message using `figma.ui.onmessage` listener:

```javascript
figma.ui.onmessage = msg => {
  if (msg.type === 'swap') {
      console.log(msg)
    }
  }
}
```

If we run the plugin now and press the swap button we should see console logging out the message with type `swap`.

So we are getting the message but how are we going to swap the colours around?  
Well we have been moving the current colours into variables at the top of the `code.js` file for this reason. Every time a selection changes we assign the relevant colours to these variables so now all we need to do is swap those variable values around and calculate the contrast again.

```javascript
//..
let foregroundAlpha
let backgroundAlpha
//...
  if (msg.type === 'swap') {
    if (figma.currentPage.selection.length > 1) {
      ;[foregroundColor, backgoundColor, foregroundAlpha, backgroundAlpha] = [
        backgoundColor,
        foregroundColor,
        backgroundAlpha,
        foregroundAlpha,
      ]
      const contrast = calculateContrast(foregroundColor, foregroundAlpha, backgoundColor)
      sendContrastInfo(contrast, foregroundColor, backgoundColor)
    }
  }
}
```

One of the ways we can do this is like this ‚òù. Ô∏èUsing arrays to swap the values of the variables without having to use a bunch of temporary variables. This is called _Destructuring Assignment Array Matching_, which really rolls off the tongue. Notice that we have also added a `backgroundAlpha` variable so that swapping the colours provides the right opacity.

In fact, if it weren‚Äôt that we need to handle foreground opacity, we wouldn‚Äôt have to re-calculate the contrast at all. The contrast ratio between two solid colours never changes, regardless of foreground or background position.

Go ahead and open this up in Figma and test it out. You should see the foreground and background colours swapping:

![A screenshot of the Figma interface demonstrating that the colours can be swapped. ](/figma-plugin/part-5/color_swap.png)

This is awesome. The colours are swapping and the score is being recalculated ‚Äî which we can see when testing on colours with opacity.

## ü©∫ Fixing a Structural Problem

There is one problem though. The `foreground` colour is being sent as the original solid colour instead of the new blended colour we produce from our `overlay()` function.  
Why? Well that‚Äôs because when we call `sendContrastInfo()` we are calling it with our global colour variables and we haven‚Äôt updated that to have our new blended colour.

So how can we fix this? Well this is a bit of a structural hole we have dug ourselves but the clear solution is to move our `sendContrastInfo()` call to be inside the `calculateContrast()` function. This will give it access to the new overlaid colour. The downside of this is now `calculateContrast()` does more than one thing which is not super clean code. For now we are just going to deal with that by renaming the function so that it‚Äôs clear it has side effects:

```javascript
function calculateAndSendContrast(foreground, alpha, backgound) {
  // ...
  let contrast = foregroundLuminance / backgroundLuminance
  if (backgroundLuminance > foregroundLuminance) {
    contrast = 1 / contrast
  }
  contrast = Math.floor(contrast * 100) / 100
  return sendContrastInfo(contrast, foreground, backgound)
}
```

Remember to call it with the locally scoped `foreground` and `background` parameters as arguments and not the globally scoped `foregroundColor` and `backgroundColor`. Then we remove the `sendContrastInfo()` call from our listeners:

```javascript
figma.on('selectionchange', () => {
  if (figma.currentPage.selection.length > 1) {
    // assigning values from selection
    calculateAndSendContrast(foregroundColor, foregroundAlpha, backgoundColor)
  }
})
figma.ui.onmessage = msg => {
  if (msg.type === 'swap') {
    // swapping variable values
      calculateAndSendContrast(foregroundColor, foregroundAlpha, backgoundColor)
    }
  }
}
```

Now in Figma we can see the right colour value is being sent to the UI:

![A screenshot of the Figma interface demonstrating that the plugin receives the correct value for the layers that contain opacity.](/figma-plugin/part-5/color_opacity.png)

Phew üòì. That was a lot. But the good news is that is all the sandbox functionality we need!

In the final chapter we are going to clean up the UI and look into some optional improvements like bundling things with webpack.
