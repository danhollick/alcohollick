You can find the code for this tutorial [here](https://github.com/danhollick/FigmaAPIThing).

At TIDAL, we have a comprehensive design system built in Figma. A little while ago, I decided to have a look at how we could use the Figma API to improve and maybe automate our workflow around this.

The problem I instantly ran into is that there are basically no resources out there demonstrating how to use it, especially at a lower technical level. So I thought I would write a little bit about how to get up and running and using the API.

It is a design tool after all, maybe designers should be able to use it. (This might be painfully slow for a more technical reader)

## What you’ll need?

- A text editor. [VSCode is good and free](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Figma.
- A mac. (It should be trivial to adapt the example to Windows, but I rely on the terminal quite a lot.)
- Some fucks to give.

## Step1: How the API works:

In essence the API is just a set of URLs, that we call _endpoints_. We can send requests to these endpoints and get responses back from them. The type of endpoint dictates what sort of stuff you get back. There are 10 endpoints currently available:

- [GET file](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#files-endpoint) — returns file info in JSON.
- [GET file node](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#nodes-endpoint)s — returns individual node info.
- [GET file images](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#images-endpoint) — returns images for specific elements.
- [GET file versions](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#get-file-versions-endpoint) — returns the version history for a file.
- [GET image fills](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#get-image-fills-endpoint) — returns download links for images in the file.
- [GET comments](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#get-comments-endpoint) — returns a list of file comments.
- [POST comments](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#post-comments-endpoint) — posts a comment.
- [GET me](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#get-me-endpoint) — returns authenticated user info.
- [GET team projects](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#get-team-projects-endpoint) — returns a list of projects.
- [GET project files](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#get-project-files-endpoint) — returns a list of files in a project.

*Before we carry on we should probably talk about what the API does not let us do:* **\*edit Figma files**.\*  
*You might notice from the list of endpoints above that all except one has the* *`GET`* *prefix before it. This means the we only have view-level access to those endpoints. The* *`POST Comments`* *endpoint lets us add a comment but that’s as far as it goes.*

_This restricts how useful the API is for sure, but I am certain the Figma team is hard at work expanding the functionality. Being able to manipulate a Figma file programmatically will open up so much exciting stuff, so hopefully that’s on the way._

## Understanding the workflow.

So what if we wanted to get a few screens from a file and display them? The basic workflow would go as follows:

- **Step1:**  
  We send a request to the `GET File` endpoint with the URL of our file as an endpoint.

- **Step 2:**  
  We get a response in return. This will be a chunk of JSON that contains all the information for every element inside that file. You can think of this as a giant list that describes all the attributes every element has (and doesn’t have).

- **Step 3:**  
  We iterate through this chunk of information and find the screens we want to display. Each element in a Figma file has a unique ID we need.

- **Step 4:**  
  Once we have found those IDs, we send them along with a new request, this time to the `GET File images` endpoint.

- **Step 5:**  
  That endpoint will then send us some more JSON, but this time it will contain URLs. These URLs are where the images of our screens are hosted by Figma.

- **Step 6:**  
  We send those URLs to our frontend to display them as images.

In **Part 2** we are going to set up a server which will communicate to the Figma API endpoints. I promise it’s not as hard as it seems.
