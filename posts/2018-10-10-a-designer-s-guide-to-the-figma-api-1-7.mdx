You can find the code for this tutorial [here](https://github.com/danhollick/FigmaAPIThing).

At TIDAL, we have a comprehensive design system built in Figma. A little while ago, I decided to have a look at how we could use the Figma API to improve and maybe automate our workflow around this.

The problem I instantly ran into is that there are basically no resources out there demonstrating how to use it, especially at a lower technical level. So I thought I would write a little bit about how to get up and running and using the API.

It is a design tool after all, maybe designers should be able to use it. (This might be painfully slow for a more technical reader)

## What you’ll need

- A text editor. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is good and free.
- Figma.
- macOS. (It should be trivial to adapt the example to Windows, but I rely on the terminal quite a lot.)

## Step 1: How the API works

In essence the API is just a set of URLs, that we call _endpoints_. We can send requests to these endpoints and get responses back from them. The type of endpoint dictates what sort of stuff you get back. There are 10 endpoints currently available:

- [GET file](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#files-endpoint) — returns file info in JSON.
- [GET file nodes](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#nodes-endpoint) — returns individual node info.
- [GET file images](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#images-endpoint) — returns images for specific elements.
- [GET file versions](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#get-file-versions-endpoint) — returns the version history for a file.
- [GET image fills](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#get-image-fills-endpoint) — returns download links for images in the file.
- [GET comments](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#get-comments-endpoint) — returns a list of file comments.
- [POST comments](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#post-comments-endpoint) — posts a comment.
- [GET me](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#get-me-endpoint) — returns authenticated user info.
- [GET team projects](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#get-team-projects-endpoint) — returns a list of projects.
- [GET project files](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#get-project-files-endpoint) — returns a list of files in a project.

<Callout>
  Before we carry on we should probably talk about what the API does not let us
  do: **edit Figma files**.
  You might notice from the list of endpoints
  above that all except one has the`GET`prefix before it. This means the
  we only have view-level access to those endpoints. The `POST
  Comments` endpoint lets us add a comment but that’s as far as it goes.

#### Update from 2022:

While this is still true, you can now manipulate Figma documents with plugins

## Understanding the workflow

So what if we wanted to get a few screens from a file and display them? The basic workflow would go as follows:

- #### Step 1:
  We send a request to the `GET File` endpoint with the URL of our file as an endpoint.

- #### Step 2:
  We get a response in return. This will be a chunk of JSON that contains all the information for every element inside that file. You can think of this as a giant list that describes all the attributes every element has (and doesn’t have).

- #### Step 3:
  We iterate through this chunk of information and find the screens we want to display. Each element in a Figma file has a unique ID we need.

- #### Step 4:
  Once we have found those IDs, we send them along with a new request, this time to the `GET File images` endpoint.

![An illustration demonstrating a server making a second request to an endpoint](/figma-api/part-1/step4.png)

- #### Step 5:
  That endpoint will then send us some more JSON, but this time it will contain URLs. These URLs are where the images of our screens are hosted by Figma.

- #### Step 6:
  We send those URLs to our frontend to display them as images.

In **Part 2** we are going to set up a server which will communicate to the Figma API endpoints. I promise it’s not as hard as it seems.
