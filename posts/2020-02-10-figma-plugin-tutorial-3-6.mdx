*\*\* The code for this section is*¬†\*[here.](https://github.com/danhollick/zebra/tree/master/step1)\*\*\*

We can finally write some plugin code üéâ. First off we need to outline what our plugin needs to do.

## üé∞ Basic Functionality

The basic flow of our plugin looks like follows:

![A flow diagram detailing the the steps for the plugin.](/figma-plugin/part-3/flow.png)

Let‚Äôs block this out in our code.

Go ahead and delete everything in `code.js` except for the line: `figma.showUI(__html__)` so we have a clean slate.

## üëÇ Listening for Selection Changes

The first thing we are going to mock up is listening for user selection changes. We can use the built in selection change listener on the `figma` instance like this:

```javascript
figma.showUI(__html__)

figma.on('selectionchange', () => {
  if (figma.currentPage.selection.length > 1) {
    // find nodes with fills that are of type SOLID
    const selection = figma.currentPage.selection.filter(
      node => node.fills.length > 0 && node.fills[0].type === 'SOLID'
    )
    console.log(selection[0].fills)
  } else {
    console.log('Select at least 2 layers')
  }
})
```

This takes two arguments. The first is a `string` that tells the listener what type of event to listen for. The second is a callback that will be fired whenever the event happens.

Now head back to Figma and hit `Plugins -> Development -> Open Console` to bring up the console. Run the plugin again from the same development menu and click on some elements you know have a fill. You should see something like this:

![A screenshot of the Figma interface with the console up and the plugin window present. ](/figma-plugin/part-3/plugin_interface.png)

This is pretty cool. Every time we select something `figma` sends the selection to our plugin.

Take a second to look at the structure of the `fills` array. Objects can have multiple fills of different types. For our case we are only interested in `SOLID` fills and we are only going to use the first one we find. We could make the plugin better later but for now this is fine.

## üßÆ How to calculate colour contrast

The method for doing this is surprisingly simple (we‚Äôre going to follow the WCAG 2.0 guidelines here) and only has two steps:

- **Get the**¬†**_relative_**¬†**_luminance_**¬†**value of the two colours.**  
  Luminance is the apparent brightness of a colour. To get this we sort of strip the hue and saturation from the colour and all that remains is the brightness of it.
- **Find the difference between the two luminance values.**  
  To do this we just divide the larger luminance value by the smaller value. The resulting number represents the contrast between the two colours.

So immediately we know we will need two functions:

- `calculateLuminance(color)`
- `calculateContrast(color1, color2)`

For now we are just going to mock them up, like so:

```javascript
figma.on('selectionchange', () => {
  if (figma.currentPage.selection.length > 1) {
    const selection = figma.currentPage.selection.filter(
      node => node.fills.length > 0 && node.fills[0].type === 'SOLID'
    )
    // filter out the first fills of each layer
    const fills = selection.map(node => node.fills[0])
    const contrast = calculateContrast(fills[0].color, fills[1].color)
    console.log(contrast)
  }
})
```

If we run the plugin now we should see something like this:

![A screenshot of the Figma interface with the console open, logging color objects.](/figma-plugin/part-3/console.png)

Alright, so we can see it‚Äôs logging the two colours we passed in as well as the number 1 which is what we are returning from the mocked luminance function.

## ‚úâÔ∏è Sending Results to the UI

Now we have our fake contrast value we want to send it to the `iframe` so we can show the user the results. To send messages to the ui we can call another method on the `figma` instance: `figma.ui.postMessage()`. We‚Äôre going to encapsulate this in another function that we will call whenever we need to tell the ui to update:

```javascript
function sendContrastInfo(contrast, foreground, backgound) {
  figma.ui.postMessage({
    type: 'selectionChange',
    foreground,
    background,
    contrast,
  })
}
```

`postMessage()` takes a `pluginMessage` as an argument and we have passed in an object which gives us the chance to pass more data in the message. It also allows us to provide a `type` property so that when the message is received in the `iframe` we can decide what to do based on the message type.

We call this in our selection listener like so:

```javascript
figma.on('selectionchange', () => {
  if (figma.currentPage.selection.length > 1) {
    const selection = figma.currentPage.selection.filter(
      node => node.fills.length > 0 && node.fills[0].type === 'SOLID'
    )
    const fills = selection.map(node => node.fills[0])
    const contrast = calculateContrast(fills[0].color, fills[1].color)
    sendContrastInfo(contrast, fills[0].color, fills[1].color)
  }
}
```

In the `iframe` we need to receive the message so go ahead and open up `ui.html` and add the following:

```html
<script>
  window.onmessage = async event => {
    const message = event.data.pluginMessage
    console.log(message)
  }
</script>
```

`window.onmessage()` is a browser event handler that listens for messages sent to a window. Events have a `data` property and Figma nests their plugin messages in a `pluginMessage` property so thats what we are intercepting here.

Make sure to remove any other `console.log()` so we don‚Äôt get confused. Then run the plugin again and make some selections:

Boom! üéâ

This is awesome. We now have everything we need to string things together:

- We are listening to selection changes.
- Passing the selection to a function that ‚Äúcalculates‚Äù contrast.
- Sending the results to the UI (even though we aren‚Äôt displaying them).

For now, we aren‚Äôt going to update the UI. We are just going to check that the messages we get there are correct by logging them out.

In the next chapter we are going flesh out the functionality.
